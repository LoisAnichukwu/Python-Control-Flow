# Python-Control-Flow


Progressing in my Python learning journey!  
I focused on control flow: making decisions and running code in loops.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Looping with `for` and `while`
- Using `break` and `continue`

| File Name         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `conditions.py`  | Examples of if-else logic |
| `logical_ops.py` | Practice with `and`, `or`, `not` |
| `for_loops.py`   | `for` loop examples (lists, ranges) |
| `while_loops.py` | Counting loops, infinite loops, and breaks |
| `guess_game.py`  | Mini number guessing game using while loop |

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- `if/else` lets Python make decisions
- `for` loops are great for known ranges or items in a list
- `while` loops run until a condition becomes false
- `break` ends a loop early; `continue` skips to the next iteration
